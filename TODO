BSON
----
+ on insert/update: reject keys that start with "$" or "."
+ data support for common mongo "$symbols"
+ convert from/to json
+ tie in with native regex like python does?
  - on outgoing uncompile?
  - on incoming automatically compile
+ more time convertibles
+ map operations for BsonDoc (or should it be applicative?)

MongoDB
-------
+ support full level 0
  - hint
  - operations on database objects
    * add_son_manipulators?
    * dereference (dbref)
  - database admin
    * getProfilingInfo
  - misc operations
    * explain
    * getCollectionOptions
  - cursor object
    * hasMore

- Query attribute: timeout
- CreateIndex attributes: background, min, max
- CreateIndex Order [Asc, Dec, Geo2d]
- FindAndModify
- getIndexInfo
- logout
- collectionsInfo
- databasesInfo
- getLastError options
- Update If Current (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations)
- block write until written on N replicas
- lazyRest on cursor, although lazy I/) is problematic and we may not want to support it.

  optional:
  - automatic reconnection
  - buffer pooling
  - connection pooling. Unsafe to shrink pool and close connections because map/reduce temp tables that were created on the connection will get deleted. Note, other connections can access a map/reduce temp table as long as the original connection is still alive. Also, other connections can access cursors created on other connections, even if those die. Cursors will be deleted on server only if idle for more than 10 minutes. Accessing a deleted cursor returns an error.
+ support safe operations, although operation with exclusive connection access is available which can be used to getLastError and check for that previous write was safe (successful).
+ auto-destoy connection (how?/when?). Although, GHC will automatically close connection (Handle) when garbage collected.
+ don't read into cursor until needed, but have cursor send getMore before
  it is actually out of docs (so network is finished by the time we're ready
  to consume more)

Misc
----
+ learn more about haskelldb, anything we can learn from there
+ go through pymongo api and figure out what parts to adopt (also look
  at other languages?)
+ kill prefix on data types "eg QO_*"?
+ javascript
+ tailable cursor support
  - only close cursor when cursorID is 0
  - have to create loop that sleeps and retries
  - lazy list support

Tests?
Documentation
  - ref

GridFS

deep "lookup" function (other deep Map functions?)
Read instance for Documents that can read its Show representation
make sure NULLs aren't in created table names

update tutorial to match new python one

+ custom types (see python examples)
+ make BSON an instance of Binary (eg get/put)

Questions:
- In Mongo shell, db.foo.totalSize fetches storageSize of each index but does not use it

Notes:
- Remember that in the new version of MongoDB (>= 1.6), "ok" field can be a number (0 or 1) or boolean (False or True). Use 'true1' function defined in Database.MongoDB.Util
- A cursor will die on the server if not accessed (by any connection) within past 10 minutes (unless NoCursorTimeout option set). Accessing a dead (or non-existent) cursor raises a ServerFailure exception.
